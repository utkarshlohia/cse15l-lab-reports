![No Arguments](https://github.com/utkarshlohia/cse15l-lab-reports/blob/main/Lab-Report-1/No%20Argument.png)

In the first line in the above screenshot, I ran the cd command without any arguments, while in the home directory, which did not change anything since the default directory to which cd takes us is the /home directory. This output is not an error.

The working directory was the home directory when I run the ls command. There was only one directory in the repository I cloned, which can be seen as the output of the ls command. Since the lecture1 directory is the only directory present in the repository, the output is not an error.

The working directory was the home directory when I run the cat command. Since I did not provide cat with any arguments, it did not print anything. This output is not an error, but there is no meaningful output since an input was not provided.
