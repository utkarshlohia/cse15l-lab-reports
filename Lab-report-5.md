TA's response:
Hi. I would suggest you try to look at the last while loop in your tests and see where you are going wrong since you are updating index1 twice. I hope this helps.

After fixing the bug:

# Part 2

In the labs, I learnt how to use vim and how to write and run bash scripts. Running command line arguments and how to run code from the command line using `javac` and `java`.
This class was very helpful in making me understand how to use github and github pages.
