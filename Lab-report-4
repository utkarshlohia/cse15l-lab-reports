# Lab Report 4


First I logged in to the remote server using ` ssh cs15lfa23go@ieng6.ucsd.edu` which was 2 up in the history, so i pressed the keys `<up><up><enter>


I cloned the forked githum repository by typing out `git clone ` and then `<cmd+v>` as the ssh link to clone was already copied to clipboard `git@github.com:utkarshlohia/lab7.git`
I changed my working directory to lab7 by typing `cd lab7`. I then ran the command `bash test.sh` to run the tests.
I typed in the command `vim ListExamples.java` to open the file in vim
I typed in the command `?index1` to reach the start of the last occurance of the word index1
I pressed `e` to reach the end of the word index1
I pressed `r2` to replace the 1 with 2.
I pressed `:wq<enter>` to save and exit.
I pressed `<up><up><enter>` to run the tests since the command `bash test.sh` was 2 up in the history
I typed the commands `git add .<enter>`, `git commit -m "Labreport"<enter>`, and `git push<enter>` to commit and push all the code to github.
